# Usage:
`python3 tif_merge.py <relative-path-to-folder>`

Merges each group of tifs to `<relative-path-to-folder>/<id>_merged.tif`

By default, the following stains are used. This can be changed by modifying the start of tif_merge.py
r = tdt
g = gfp
b = dapi

NOTE: The relative-path-to-folder must only contain the tifs to be merged
